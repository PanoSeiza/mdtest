CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.5.0 - The "Quality of Life" Update

- Added "Last World or Server" placeholder that returns the last world/server or an empty value if no last world/server was set (#1091)
- Added a "Template Mode" for buttons, so the button will apply many of its settings like textures and sounds to all other buttons in the screen (#1009, #672)
- Added "Is Internet Connection Available" loading requirement to check if there's a working internet connection available
- Added "Back to Last Screen" action to open the screen that was open before the current one (#511)
- Added more grid sizes for the editor (50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
- Added grid snapping feature to the layout editor (#780)
  - Snapping precision is configurable
  - Can be toggled off
- Added a search bar to the actions browser to search for actions by their names and descriptions (Add/Edit Action Screen)
- Added a search bar to the requirements browser to search for requirements by their names and descriptions (Add/Edit Requirement Screen)
- Added a search bar to the placeholders browser in the text editor to search for placeholders by their names, descriptions and identifiers
- Added a search bar to the variables browser in the Manage Variables screen to search for variables by their names and values (#743)
- It is now possible to move layers (elements) in the Layer widget by dragging them (with multi-selection support) (#1112)
- The Layers widget lets you make layers (elements) invisible in the editor now without actually deleting them (they will be visible outside the editor) (#1112)
- The Manage Variables screen now shows the variable's value after each variable name
- Placeholders can now be edited with multi-line support in the text editor (this feature is experimental, so it could break stuff in some cases)
- The color formatting of placeholders in the text editor got reworked to be more useful (they now get formatted similar to other text editors format JSON-like text)
- Updated names and descriptions of all placeholders, actions and requirements related to FM's variables to be more clear
- The placeholder browser in the text editor now dynamically changes its size based on the window size to be able to better see long placeholder names
- There's now an unsaved changes indicator in the layout editor (#658)
- Context menus are now scrollable when they are too long for the window size (#1110)
- You can now set a hover sound for Custom Slider elements (was only possible for Custom Button elements and Vanilla sliders/buttons before) (#1015)
- Replaced the old hardcoded dummy Title screen elements (logo, splash, branding, realms button icons) with actual widgets, which means they can be moved now and basically work like Vanilla buttons (#656)
- Improved the error handling of the "Join Server" action (#1055)
- It will now display a warning when trying to execute the "Open Screen or Custom GUI" action asynchronously in a Ticker element (it will not execute the action anymore, because that breaks the game)
- Removed the old and deprecated "Run Button Script" action, since it got replaced by the action script system long time ago
- Removed the old and long deprecated Text element from FancyMenu v2, because it got replaced by the new Text element in FancyMenu v3
- Removed the old and long deprecated Slider element from FancyMenu v2, because it got replaced by the new Slider element in FancyMenu v3
- Internally there were still some leftovers from the old animation system for backwards compatibility with other mods, which got REMOVED now, so some mods could break
- Fixed raw text components fail to get parsed when they don't start with " { " (#1089)
- Fixed FancyMenu creating directories in "/" when loaded server-side (hopefully fixed, not 100% sure if that fix works every time) (#1056)
- Fixed custom slider textures broken in MC 1.21.4 (#1106)
- Fixed description of "Mouse Clicked" requirement showing as one line instead of multiple lines
- Fixed undo/redo in the text editor not working when adding placeholders via the placeholder browser (#1109)
- Fixed "Format Error" in description of "Current Audio Track" placeholder
- Fixed unable to undo/redo moving an element in the editor when it got moved only 1 pixel
- Fixed up/down arrows of layers in the Layer widget not correctly showing as normal/greyed out when a layer is at the very top or very bottom of the list
- Fixed incompatibility with Valkyrien Skies 2 (#1119, #957)
- Hopefully fixed JSON placeholder sometimes not showing its replacement anymore after reloading FancyMenu (#1100)
